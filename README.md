# Zelda Rust

Welcome to the **Zelda Rust** project! This is a Rust-based project inspired by the Zelda universe. Back in Highschool I was given a small project to code in python, the gameplay would be pretty boring considering you'd play it on a terminal (you can find the subject [here](https://github.com/thomaschrtt/zelda-rust/blob/master/sujet_initial.pdf) sorry it's in french :p). I wanted to challenge myself and make a game that would be more fun to play, so I decided to use Rust, a language I had never used before, and make a 2D game.
Below, you'll find instructions on how to set up, build, and run the project, along with sections for lore and keybinds.

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:
```bash
cargo build
```

> **Note:** Some antivirus software may block the build process. If this happens, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception for the project directory.

## Running the Project

Once the build is complete, you can run the project with:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Lore

A knight named Link must rescue Princess Zelda. To achieve this, he will journey through an enchanted world where he must liberate towers by discovering shrines. Each tower contains 4 shrines. To reveal the first shrine, Link must climb to the top of a tower and activate it. He then needs to travel to the shrine and interact with it. Upon success, Link must return to the tower to learn his next destination. But beware, many enemies lurk along the way... Once all the shrines of a tower have been activated, he must move on to the next tower and restart the quest for shrines. When all the shrines have been completed, the princess is freed.
